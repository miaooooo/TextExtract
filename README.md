This project is about developing an OCR system to detect text in images.Due to complexity of natural scenes,illumination 
effects and non-uniformity of background,this task is a difficult Computer Vision problem.Our aim is to develop a more 
efficient system with better accuracy to recognize text in all kind of images using computer vision techiques and 
statistical techniques.
